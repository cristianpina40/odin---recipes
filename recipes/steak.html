    <h1>Steak</h1>
    <img src="../images/steak.jpeg">
    <p>Steak is a common dish that can be served with many different sides.</p>
    <p>Steak is usually made with beef, but it can be made with other meat, such as deer meat.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 1 1/2 to 2-inch-thick ribeye, strip, porterhouse, or T-bone steaks (about 1 pound/450g each), or 4 tenderloin steaks (6 to 8 ounces/170 to 225g each)</li>
        <li> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 4 sprigs thyme or rosemary (optional) </li>
        <li>  2 cloves garlic (optional)</li>
        <li>  2 shallots, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons (30g) butter (if pan-searing; optional)</li>
    </ul>    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Add vegetable, canola, or rice bran oil to a heavy cast iron or stainless steel skillet, then place over the hottest burner you have and preheat skillet until it starts to smoke.</li>
        <li> Gently lay steak in skillet, using your fingers or a set of tongs. If desired, add a tablespoon of butter; for a cleaner-tasting sear, omit the butter at this stage.</li>
        <li> After 15 to 30 seconds, flip steak so that the second side comes into contact with the pan. Repeat, flipping steak every 15 to 30 seconds, until it has developed a nice brown sear </li>
        <li> Transfer cooked steak to a cutting board or serving platter and serve immediately.</li>
       
    </ol>
